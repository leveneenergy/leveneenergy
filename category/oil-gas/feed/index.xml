change has roused an urgent need to reduce emissions and stabilize global
temperatures. This is a fundamental call to work towards mitigating the
possible impacts that could affect our ecosystem, communities, and biodiversity
at a regional and on a global scale.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Before we delve into the
subject, let’s talk a bit about climate change. Climate change refers to the
long-term drift of weather in a specific region. This change is as a result of
interactions between the sun, the earth and human activities. The energy from
the sun warms the earth and the earth subsequently releases heat into the
atmosphere. Some gases in the atmosphere envelopes this heat and thereafter,
these gases act like the decanter in a greenhouse which led to it being
referred to as greenhouse gases. Heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases, some
of which are radiated into the earth leading to a rise in surface temperature.
This process is known as the ‘greenhouse effect’. Although the greenhouse
effect is known to be a natural phenomenon, it is however intensified by daily
human activities, thereby increasing the greenhouse gas levels in the
atmosphere, which is directly proportional to the increasing heat trap
resulting in the overall warming of the earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Over the years,
industrial processes and the combustion of fossil fuels have been identified as
the major contributors to the increase in carbon-dioxide, which has led to
rapid climate change in our present time. This has resulted in concerted
efforts in working towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from various human
activities to keep the earth habitable. According to the United Nation
Environment Programme (UNEP) Emission Gap Report (EGR) 2022: ‘The Closing
Window – Climate Crisis Calls for Rapid Transformation of Societies’ finds that
the international community is falling far short of the Paris goals, with no
credible pathway to the 1.5</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">ᵒ</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">c target in place. The report states
that only urgent, system-wide transformations can deliver the significant
savings needed to limit greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, with urgent actions
deployed in the power, industrial, transportation, real estate, food and
financial sectors.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">One of the more
efficient ways to stabilize global temperature is to adopt zero – carbon
emission through Carbon Capturing Underground Storage (CCUS) and it is becoming
increasingly important in today’s world of energy transition for the following
reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul type="disc">

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: One of the primary reasons for
     the use of CCUS is to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing
     the concentration of carbon-dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. With the
     ongoing shift towards renewable energy sources, CCUS can help to reduce
     the amount for a significant portion of global carbon emissions.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     low-carbon economy by allowing the continued use of fossil fuels while
     reducing emissions. This can provide a bridge to a time when renewable
     energy sources can fully replace fossil fuels.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: Furthermore, CCUS can provide
     energy security by helping to maintain a diverse energy mix that includes
     fossil fuels. As renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power are
     intermittent, CCUS can provide a reliable baseload power capacity that can
     help to ensure a stable and secure energy supply.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

the process of using technology in capturing and storing carbon-dioxide (CO2)
from the atmosphere and/or several other sources such as fossil fuels, power
plants, factories, transportation, and industrial processes. The captured CO2
is then stored in long-term reservoirs such as geological formations and

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: this involves injecting
     captured CO2 into oil reservoirs to help extract additional oil. The CO2
     is then stored underground in the reservoirs, effectively sequestrating
     the carbon. This process not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions
     from oil production but also increases the amount of oil that can be
     extracted from a reservoir, making the process more efficient and cost
     effective.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

the potential to generate significant business revenues in a variety of ways.
Here are some of the main revenue streams associated with CCUS:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul type="disc">
 <li style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size:

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: This is known to be one of the
     main revenue streams for CCUS. It entails the sale of carbon credits or
     the inclusion of CCUS projects in carbon pricing schemes. These systems
     provide a financial incentive for companies to reduce their carbon
     emissions, and CCUS projects can generate carbon credits that can be
     marketed or used to offset emissions elsewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: Governments around the world
     provide various incentives and grants for companies to develop and
     implement CCUS technologies. These incentives can take the form of tax
     credits, grants or subsidies that can help cover the costs associated with
     CCUS projects.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
 <li style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size:

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: There are also opportunities
     for investors to finance CCUS projects and earn returns on their
     investments. For example, investors can fund the development of CCUS
     technologies or invest in companies that are developing or implementing
     these technologies.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

question asked at the beginning of this article, it is very possible to have a
zero-carbon emission society. and this article has attempted at shedding light
on the various uses of CCUS technologies. Generally, CCUS is an important component
of energy transition towards a low-carbon future and is critical for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions. Moreso, CCUS technologies has the potential to
generate significant business revenues through carbon credits, EOR, grants and
investment opportunities. As the demand for carbon reduction and
decarbonization continues to grow, the business opportunities associated with
CCUS are likely to increase commensurately.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>

top-burner during most discussions regarding energy for the future. Solar power
is usually the primary option when renewable energy is considered. There are

provide a basic understanding of how the different components of the solar
system work. The aim is to demystify solar systems, making it easy for
everyone, no matter your background, to know what happens within a solar
system.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">There is an adage that
say, “What man does not understand, he fears; and what he fears, he tends to
destroy.” I hope that this article provides the understanding that takes away

practical and simplified as possible, we will be using a family unit as an
analogy for the solar system.

Solar Panels)</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Most people recognize
the solar panel component of the solar system as it is the most visible. The
solar panels are responsible for transforming light energy to electrical
energy. This is done through what is known as the photoelectric effect. This
simply means that when certain materials (e.g., silicon) are exposed to light,
they will react to the exposure by producing electricity.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">With solar power
systems, the solar panels are where the magic begins, and light is exchanged
for electricity. The challenge is that the electricity produced by the solar
panels is in a raw state and some refining must be done before it is suitable
for ‘consumption’. This is where the next component, the Charge Controller,
comes into play.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">The charge controller
(Miss Charge controller)</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Following on from the
‘family’ analogy, we can consider the Charge Controller as a protector or maybe
a doctor. The Charge Controller receives the electrical power from the solar
panel and gives it a treatment that ensures the electrical power is right for
the battery. This is more like what happens when water is filtered to ensure it
is healthy for human consumption.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Apart from treating the
power from the solar panels, the Charge Controller ensures that the battery
stops receiving power when it gets fully charged. This ensures the health of
the battery is maintained at optimum capacity. Simply put, the Charge Controller
ensures that the battery is healthy by making sure it is working within safe
limits.<br>

<b>The battery/storage (Mrs. Battery)</b><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Given that sunlight is
present for a limited number of hours in a day, there must be a way to store
energy produced during the sunlight hours for use when there is no sunlight or
little sunlight. This is where the battery takes the lead. The battery is a
storage system that can be likened to a water tank. You store the excess power
generated in a battery and use this power when you have little or no power from
other sources (i.e., solar panels, power grids or standby generators). The
battery can also receive power from other sources like the generator and
electric power grid. This power is processed by the inverter before being
directed to the battery. The battery is usually what requires the most
attention and is, most of the time, the most expensive component. A wide range
of technologies have been deployed to ensure the battery is safer for use, the
battery’s lifespan is improved, and the battery’s weight is reduced, amongst
many other considerations. Storage holds the key to reliable power supply from
solar power systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">The Inverter (Mr.

mentioned components deal with one form of electric power, and this is Direct
Current (DC) power. However, most of what is powered makes use of another form
of power known as Alternating Current (AC) power. This therefore means that the
power from the solar panels to the charge controller to the battery is all
Direct Current, but the power required by must equipment or appliances is
Alternating Current. To make this change from Direct Current to Alternating
Current, we have to introduce the Inverter. The name ‘inverter’ means to
“invert” from Direct Current (DC) to Alternating current (AC). As simple as the
inverter’s job may seem, a lot is involved in the process of inverting from
Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC). The inverter is one component
that has advanced reasonably with efficiencies getting to as high as 99%. The
charge controller is sometime housed in the same unit as the inverter. This
means that both units will become one and is this consolidated device is called
a “hybrid inverter”.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">In Summary<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:

<p><strong>By: Nneamaka Atuanya, Senior Geoscientist and Sustainability Champion</strong></p>



<p>As part of a series of editorials on Sustainability and Sustainable Development, we wrote about sustainable energy, the need for sustainable development, and the impact of renewable energy sources. In this month’s article, we will delve into the history of one of the most important sources of renewable energy: Solar Energy.</p>



<p>Human beings have always been aware of the power of the sun and have utilized this energy in ways ranging from drying farm produce using the heat of the sun to heating water for a bath. However, in the year 1839, the way we utilize the energy from the sun changed when a 19-year-old French boy, Edmond Becquerel, discovered the photovoltaic effect and put forward an explanation for how electricity can be generated from exposing a liquid electrolyte to sunlight. Despite the inefficiency of his methods, this paved the way for other scientists like William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day to observe the photovoltaic effect in solidified selenium.</p>



<p>In 1883, Charles Fritz installed a solar cell with less than 1% efficiency. This was a major breakthrough, but at the time, non-renewable power sources were able to produce electricity with higher efficiency, and this meant that the adoption of solar cells was ineffective and very expensive. Advancements in solar cell development stalled until the space race rejuvenated interest in solar energy. This is due to the fact that scientists can generate power using solar cells directly in space; instead of using batteries which were heavier and far more expensive.</p>



<p>As we learnt in the previous editorial on Sustainable Energy published in the February 2023 newsletter, we cannot continue to depend on non-renewable sources of energy, as our increasing demand means that we will exhaust those resources eventually. We need renewable sources of energy to satisfy and maintain our energy needs and direct radiation from the sun is a massive resource that can provide solutions.</p>



<p>Solar energy is likely to become the backbone of global energy systems. Photovoltaic technology has developed rapidly over the last 10 years, with solar cell technologies becoming more efficient and less expensive. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the cost of electricity from utility-scale solar photovoltaics fell by 85% between 2010 and 2020. This means that the use of solar technologies is no longer limited to big budget projects like space travel; we now use solar energy to power our homes, schools, offices, hospitals, communities, worship centers etc. Businesses are now utilizing solar technology as an alternative power source, thereby reducing operating cost and increasing efficiency. In many countries, companies benefit from government incentives and tax credit designed to accelerate deployment of solar technologies.</p>



<p>Aside from government incentives, several international organizations have solar energy funds and carbon credit schemes to enable companies and end users acquire reliable solar solutions and earn carbon credits while utilizing solar energy systems.</p>



<p>As stated in the aforementioned editorial, organizations that utilize renewable energy solutions are smart businesses, and we are about to witness one of the greatest transformations in the global energy system. Companies and organizations should find ways to develop strategic sustainable goals to take advantage of some of these funds and incentives by investing in a sustainable project or by utilizing renewable energy.</p>

<p><strong>By: Nneamaka Atuanya, Senior Geoscientist and Sustainability Champion</strong></p>



<p>In the previous editorial in this series, we introduced the concepts of Sustainability and Sustainable Development. In this edition, we will focus on Sustainable Energy and why it is necessary for sustainable development.</p>



<p>John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies defines Sustainable Energy as energy derived from resources that can fulfill our current energy needs without compromising the energy needs, environment, or climate of future generations.</p>



<p><strong>Sustainable energy? Why now:</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, sustainable energy is key to ending global energy poverty and subsequently, many other forms of poverty. Energy poverty, according to Habitat for Humanity, is a lack of adequate, affordable, reliable, quality, safe, and environmentally sound energy services to support development. Solving energy poverty is very crucial to solving environmental and social problems as it is impossible to develop the agricultural and manufacturing sectors without sufficient energy. Inadequate energy traps the poorest countries in a vicious poverty cycle as they cannot afford the energy that can drive them out of poverty.</p>



<p>Sustainable energy is about solving social and health problems using environmentally clean and affordable forms of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, about 1.2 billion people globally lack access to electricity and solely depend on sunlight to function. This reality, as you can imagine, drastically reduces the productive and leisure time of these people.</p>



<p>Poor accessibility to national electricity structures, funding, and lack of suitable technology have made it very difficult and expensive to connect such communities to traditional electrical infrastructure. With sustainable energy, most of these challenges become solvable as the sources of energy (sun, wind, biomass) are locally and readily accessible. Taking solar energy as an example, the energy required (from the sun) to generate electricity is readily available. With the community being the main beneficiary of this, they can also take charge of managing, maintaining, and securing the renewable energy infrastructure.</p>



<p>The level of development and empowerment a simple off-grid solar power system can bring to a community is unimaginable. With electrified classrooms and streetlights, students will have access to information technology and will be motivated to study more. With solar powered equipment/machines farmers, hunters, fishermen can produce more, and better preserve some of their produce with refrigerators. With solar-powered pumping machines, cleaner water can be provided, and better sanitation can be achieved. A reliable solar power system will enable a more effective healthcare care services in rural communities.</p>



<p>The adoption of sustainable energy entails much more than solving social problems; it is smart business – very smart. Globally, the sustainable energy industry accounts for an annual revenue of about USD$1.4 billion. Additionally, the three largest financial institutions in the United States of America (Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America) have pledged to commit over USD$370 billion to the renewable energy and low carbon sector by 2025.</p>



<p>Technology, internal innovation, and purposeful investment are key to proffering solutions to the challenge of access to clean and affordable energy. For example, the perfection of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) technologies has allowed for buildings to be powered by BIPV panels, reducing energy costs drastically.</p>



<p>As we learn more about sustainable energy we will see how off-grid technologies provide key solutions.</p>



<p>In the next article we will spotlight on some of these solutions and their financial opportunities.</p>

<p>Conversations surrounding mental health remain a taboo subject, particularly in the context of African society, in general and especially in the workplace. There exists a stigma attached to anyone who suggests that they are going through a difficult time mentally. The implication being that such a person is seen as weak or ‘less than’. These can be harmful stereotypes, particularly when allied with the fact that it consequently prevents people dealing with such challenges to speak up and seek appropriate help. From firsthand experience, it is imperative to state categorically how important the support of loved ones, family, friends and colleagues is to people who experience challenges with their mental health, particularly in the midst of navigating life as an adult in the world we currently live in. Granted, practically everyone experiences one form of pressure or the other, whether it be at work or at home, professionally or personally. However, by virtue of the fact that we are all created uniquely, it goes without saying that we react to pressures (external or otherwise) in different ways. Therapists can confirm that in some cases, the effects of mental health challenges on a person’s anatomy can actually present in physical manifestation such that it can alter the way your body reacts and even weakens one’s immune system, leading to suffering other ailments that would typically not be directly linked to proper brain function.</p>



<p>It is with this in mind that we urge everyone to take conversations surrounding mental health seriously. Whether it be in a family unit, a religious community or even (and especially) in the workplace, considering that is where most adults spend a majority of their time, interacting with colleagues and/or customers and clients (depending on the sector they work in or their specific job function). At Levene Energy, our Health Management Organization (HMO) offers resources that help alleviate the effects of mental health challenges on members of staff and we encourage employees to take advantage of these resources.</p>



<p>For as long as human beings have been in existence, there has always been and will always be a need for support from a community. To anyone experiencing challenges and seeking professional help, just know that it is a marathon and not a sprint. So, take it one day at a time and all things considered, with proper guidance and the support of medical professionals and loved ones, know that better days are up ahead.</p>



<p>For comprehensive resources on mental health awareness, please contact a certified medical professional or your HMO.</p>

<p><strong>By: Nneamaka Atuanya, Senior Geoscientist and Sustainability Champion</strong></p>



<p>As a Geoscientist whose main goal in over 12 years has been to employ the most efficient and cost-effective means of exploiting oil and gas resources, I am thrilled to be writing this editorial, and that you – the reader – have decided to embark on this sustainable journey with us in 2023. My journey into sustainability has really changed my world view and I wish the same for you.</p>



<p>In this article, we will introduce the concepts of Sustainability and Sustainable Development. Different definitions exist for sustainability depending on context, but they generally mean the same thing. The Cambridge dictionary states that, “Sustainability is the quality of being able to continue over a period of time”. Defining sustainability on its own does not give us the required background for this journey however, which is why we will also talk about sustainable development.</p>



<p>According to United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) report, ‘Our Common Future (1987)’, sustainable development is the ability to meet the present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This call to a conscious way of living and doing business gives us the power to decide whether future generations will thrive or not, and it is a huge responsibility.</p>



<p>At the heart of the WCED report are the 3 P’s: Profit, Planet, People. This can also be known as the 3 E’s: Economy, Environment, and Equity. In order to be considered sustainable, businesses must be able to utilize natural resources reasonably, support a healthy community and their workforce, and earn enough revenue to remain financially feasible for the long-term (Source: Investopedia).</p>



<p>These principles are at the center of all Levene Energy’s business strategies and decisions. As an innovative and ever-evolving energy company, we continuously integrate sustainable practices into our business model. Levene Energy, through its joint venture company, LPV Energies Limited, leverages on the latest technology, innovative design, and seamless project execution to deliver top notch renewable energy solutions to our clients and customers. Currently, LPV Energies is executing the largest Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) project in Africa. Furthermore, there are other projects in the pipeline to provide power using solar energy in rural areas in Nigeria.</p>



<p>With Gas being accepted as a transition energy source, Levene Energy has taken strategic actions to build and operate gas pipelines by signing an Unincorporated Joint Venture (UJV) agreement with the NNPC Gas Marketing Limited (NGML) to distribute gas across different locations in Nigeria. Based on our 2023 goals, we have specific sustainable practices we wish to integrate, and we have identified the metrics by which we will measure our progress. We will share our journey with all our stakeholders as we proceed, so stay tuned.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>By: Yinka Adelodun GM, Upstream &amp; Engineering Divisions</strong></h5>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The year 2022 is a year that we have experienced or seen the manifestation of our changing climate. We have all heard the news of forest fires in America and Europe, heatwaves in Europe with London hitting 42oC, a third of Pakistan is under water due to extreme flooding, and most recently hurricanes Fiona and Ian causing utter devastations in Canada and US respectively. We are experiencing climate change in Nigeria also, as can be observed with desertification in the Northern part of the country and series of floodings that have been reported in places like Lokoja and Enugu.</p>



<p>All these extreme weather conditions are being attributed to Green House Gases (GHGs) we are emitting because of our dependence on burning hydrocarbon-based energy sources to power global economies, especially the developed countries economies. Unfortunately, the more we emit GHGs, the more we increase the capacity of earth’s atmosphere to capture heat and the more rapidly our climate will change. These changes will be manifested through extreme weather conditions.</p>



<p>Because of our changing climate due to GHG emissions, the world is now looking at transitioning away from hydrocarbon-based energy sources into more sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydrogen.</p>



<p>Any company that wants to stay relevant in the Energy Industry must actively look at ways it can participate in the Energy Transition space. Not only does this make sense from ensuring we leave a healthy world for the next generation but it also makes sense from a business perspective because Levene are in the Energy Industry, and not just the oil and gas Industry. Levene Energy Group is determined to be part of the solution, and that is why we have a clear strategy to do our part to support the energy transition agenda of Nigeria and the world in general.</p>



<p>As we all know, our core competence at Levene is commodity trading. Our strength is in connecting energy feedstocks to off-takers in an economically viable manner. There are two key areas of Energy Transition space we believe we can leverage our strength, and these areas are in natural gas and solar energy. We have developed our strategy around these two sources of energy. This editorial is focused on our natural gas strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Natural Gas – The Transition Energy Source</strong></p>



<p>Most in the world have accepted that natural gas is the transition energy source would support the world to move from hydrocarbon-based energy sources to more sustainable energy sources. Where possible, natural gas will be used to replace coal and oil applications because gas, when burnt, has a lower GHG emission footprint when compared to coal or oil. As an example, coal power plants are now being replaced with gas power plants in developed countries such as Canada and the US; even China is going through the same process.</p>



<p>In addition to gas being the transition energy source, gas has also become an energy security commodity because of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Europeans are now actively looking for secured sources of LNG to power their economies. Nigeria is well positioned to take advantage of this situation because the country has over 200 Tcf of gas in reserve.</p>



<p>Lastly, and most importantly, Nigeria and Africa in general, need natural gas to power its economies. Natural gas does not require significant processing and refining like oil. Natural gas can be used for electric power generation, transportation, and cooking. Natural gas has an additional advantage in Nigeria because it cannot be easily stolen like oil.</p>



<p><strong>Our Strategy</strong></p>



<p>For us at Levene, our strategy is to support the development of the midstream of natural gas value chain in Nigeria. We plan to be an active participant in managing gas processing plants and pipelines. We are also looking to get involved with LNG processing and transportation to help feed the world with Nigeria natural gas. We will leverage our strong relationships with financial institutions to bring investment to develop gas fields in Nigeria and secure long-term offtake agreements for both natural gas and LNG. All this plays into our strength, and that is linking energy feedstocks to off-takers.</p>



<p>We are already taking concrete steps in achieving our ambition. We were recently awarded gas distribution franchise licenses for both Ibeju-Lekki and Badagry-Seme Gas Distribution Areas by the Nigeria Gas Marketing Company Limited. We are in active conversation with Nigeria Gas Company to build gas processing facilities. We are also seeking to bring investment to Nigeria to develop strategic OML gas fields. We are working with major players in Europe to secure long-term offtake agreements for Nigerian gas.</p>



<p>It is truly an exciting time to be part of the Levene family because we have a management team that is determined to execute on its strategy to be part of the solution to help transition the world to more sustainable forms of energy.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>By: Amina Maitama, Business Development Officer</strong></h5>



<p>In order to promote clean and sustainable economic growth and reduce carbon emissions, developed (and some emerging) economies around the world, now place very strong emphasis on renewable energy sources. However, critics of renewable energy frequently provide reasons why they believe it will take a while for the world to move away from its reliance on fossil fuels. Nevertheless, it’s about time some of these misconceptions are put to rest. Here are a few common misconceptions about Renewable Energy:</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Fossil Fuels are irreplaceable</strong></p>



<p>Fact: Renewable energy, as the name implies, suggests an infinite energy supply as its source is regenerative, whereas fossil fuels have a finite supply and are either not continually produced or being produced very slowly. Renewable energy can become the primary source of global energy and this will ultimately expedite the end of our over-reliance on fossil fuels. A brighter global future will be assured by diversifying our energy source-mix, incorporating additional renewable sources like biomass, solar, geothermal, wind, hydropower and fuel cell technologies, and by fashioning ways of utilizing them efficiently. Furthermore, the price volatility of natural gas and petroleum products, as well as their effects on the environment, would also be a substantial reason for fossil fuels to become extinct.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Fossil Fuels are cheaper than Renewable Energy sources</strong></p>



<p>Fact: The misconception is that switching to renewable energy is too expensive for widespread acceptance and that neither society nor the government can afford the significant costs of a full-scale change. In nations that account for three-quarters of the global GDP, renewable energy is now the least expensive source of electricity (source: BloombergNEF’s The New Energy Outlook, 2021). It&#8217;s not just less expensive; it&#8217;s also more effective. From a technological perspective, wind and solar power systems have made tremendous strides, and their installation prices have significantly decreased.</p>

In nations that account for three-quarters of the global GDP, renewable energy is now the least expensive source of electricity (source: BloombergNEF’s The New Energy Outlook, 2021). It&#8217;s not just less expensive; it&#8217;s also more effective. From a technological perspective, wind and solar power systems have made tremendous strides, and their installation prices have significantly decreased.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Renewable Energy Sources are inadequate for the energy demand</strong></p>



<p>Fact: Nigeria has a wealth of renewable energy sources to satisfy its energy requirements; recent studies estimate that Nigeria has a solar thermal power potential of about 427,000MW. (source: The SUNGAS project – Renewable Energy Potential in Nigeria). This volume is less than the energy generated by other renewable energy sources. As a result, these renewable energy sources can adequately cover our present electrical needs. The difficulty resides in the ability of governments and relevant authorities to accelerate the energy transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Renewable Energy is unreliable</strong></p>



<p>Fact: According to conventional thinking, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and other green energy sources makes them excessively unpredictable. Evidently, solar power plants often do not work at night, just as wind turbines do not operate when there is no wind. However, innovative technology advancements in storage have now made it possible to store produced energy and deliver it later, when needed by the end-user.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Switching to renewable energy will kill jobs</strong></p>



<p>Fact: A wide variety of jobs, including those for engineers, contractors, manufacturers, and suppliers, are being created as a result of the renewable energy revolution. Jobs in renewable energy can be created both directly and indirectly throughout the entire value chain, including production, manufacturing and distribution of equipment, or even in the provision of services like installation, project management, operation, and maintenance.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Solar panels are made using harmful techniques and are not recyclable</strong></p>



<p>Fact: A solar panel&#8217;s primary components are silicon, aluminum, glass, and copper which are recyclable in large quantities. Its production does not entail a particularly hazardous process, that requires additional safeguards and safety precautions above and beyond those for a typical industrial operation. Over a span of more than 25 years, they will continue to produce pure, cost-free energy. When a solar panel reaches the end of its useful life, its parts are categorized as non-hazardous waste and are recyclable.</p>



<p>All of the above is why LPV Energies Limited, a subsidiary of Levene Energy Holdings, has designed a portfolio of innovative projects targeted at spearheading the growth of the renewable energy sector in Nigeria and Africa at large, thereby bridging the energy demand gap while also working with the Nigerian government to meet its greenhouse gas commitments. By making wise energy decisions that have fewer negative consequences on the environment, each of us can contribute to the greenhouse solution and thereby influence changes that would slow down global warming and protect our world.&nbsp;For more information on our renewable energy activities, visit <a href="blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.lpvenergies.com</a> and <a href="http://www.lpvtechnologies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.lpvtechnologies.com</a></p>
