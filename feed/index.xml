change has roused an urgent need to reduce emissions and stabilize global
temperatures. This is a fundamental call to work towards mitigating the
possible impacts that could affect our ecosystem, communities, and biodiversity
at a regional and on a global scale.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Before we delve into the
subject, let’s talk a bit about climate change. Climate change refers to the
long-term drift of weather in a specific region. This change is as a result of
interactions between the sun, the earth and human activities. The energy from
the sun warms the earth and the earth subsequently releases heat into the
atmosphere. Some gases in the atmosphere envelopes this heat and thereafter,
these gases act like the decanter in a greenhouse which led to it being
referred to as greenhouse gases. Heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases, some
of which are radiated into the earth leading to a rise in surface temperature.
This process is known as the ‘greenhouse effect’. Although the greenhouse
effect is known to be a natural phenomenon, it is however intensified by daily
human activities, thereby increasing the greenhouse gas levels in the
atmosphere, which is directly proportional to the increasing heat trap
resulting in the overall warming of the earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Over the years,
industrial processes and the combustion of fossil fuels have been identified as
the major contributors to the increase in carbon-dioxide, which has led to
rapid climate change in our present time. This has resulted in concerted
efforts in working towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from various human
activities to keep the earth habitable. According to the United Nation
Environment Programme (UNEP) Emission Gap Report (EGR) 2022: ‘The Closing
Window – Climate Crisis Calls for Rapid Transformation of Societies’ finds that
the international community is falling far short of the Paris goals, with no
credible pathway to the 1.5</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">ᵒ</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">c target in place. The report states
that only urgent, system-wide transformations can deliver the significant
savings needed to limit greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, with urgent actions
deployed in the power, industrial, transportation, real estate, food and
financial sectors.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">One of the more
efficient ways to stabilize global temperature is to adopt zero – carbon
emission through Carbon Capturing Underground Storage (CCUS) and it is becoming
increasingly important in today’s world of energy transition for the following
reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul type="disc">

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: One of the primary reasons for
     the use of CCUS is to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing
     the concentration of carbon-dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. With the
     ongoing shift towards renewable energy sources, CCUS can help to reduce
     the amount for a significant portion of global carbon emissions.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     low-carbon economy by allowing the continued use of fossil fuels while
     reducing emissions. This can provide a bridge to a time when renewable
     energy sources can fully replace fossil fuels.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: Furthermore, CCUS can provide
     energy security by helping to maintain a diverse energy mix that includes
     fossil fuels. As renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power are
     intermittent, CCUS can provide a reliable baseload power capacity that can
     help to ensure a stable and secure energy supply.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">: This is known to be one of the
     main revenue streams for CCUS. It entails the sale of carbon credits or
     the inclusion of CCUS projects in carbon pricing schemes. These systems
     provide a financial incentive for companies to reduce their carbon
     emissions, and CCUS projects can generate carbon credits that can be
     marketed or used to offset emissions elsewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

question asked at the beginning of this article, it is very possible to have a
zero-carbon emission society. and this article has attempted at shedding light
on the various uses of CCUS technologies. Generally, CCUS is an important component
of energy transition towards a low-carbon future and is critical for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions. Moreso, CCUS technologies has the potential to
generate significant business revenues through carbon credits, EOR, grants and
investment opportunities. As the demand for carbon reduction and
decarbonization continues to grow, the business opportunities associated with
CCUS are likely to increase commensurately.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>

<p><strong>By: Nzan Ogbe, Group Chief Executive Officer, Levene Energy Holdings</strong></p>



<p>We all have several needs but surely not enough money and resources to meet them all. How do you adequately satisfy the need for food, clothing and shelter for one and ensure that the needs of another, who will be born 40 years after, will also be adequately met without one affecting the other? Sustainable development hopes to get this done.</p>



<p>The phrase ‘Sustainable Development’ became an anthem after the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 adopted the Sustainable Development Goals to achieve a better world. Beyond the anthem, sustainable development seeks to ensure a world where human needs are met without disrupting the stability and integrity of our planet.</p>



<p>The UN has listed 17 goals as steps to how it can attain sustainable development. They include zero hunger, no poverty, good health and well-being, quality education, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and infrastructure, sustainable cities and communities, responsible production and consumption, and climate action.</p>



<p>However, energy lies at the centre of the climate equation and the quest to build a sustainable world. In fact, the United Nations describes it as the key to solving some of the challenges being experienced.</p>



<p>From heat production to keep us warm to electricity generation to power homes, industries and fuel for vehicles, trains and aeroplanes, energy plays a vital role in human existence. Thus, it cannot be ignored in the quest to build a sustainable world.</p>



<p>Fossil fuels, such as oil &amp; gas and coal, have been identified as the largest contributors to the climate change problem. Data from the UN shows that fossil fuels are responsible for an estimated 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions and about 75% of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p>The effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on the environment can be likened to that of a blanket. It traps heat from the sun and reduces the earth’s ability to cool itself by radiating this heat back into space. This has led to a phenomenon called climate change, where the earth is hotter, and there is increased drought and more severe storms – to mention a few.</p>



<p>To avoid the worst impact of climate change, the UN has set a goal to reduce emissions by almost half in 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050. This is the basis for the climate change conversation.</p>



<p>Seeing how crucial the need for energy is for human survival, alternative energy sources are being explored on a daily basis. This research has resulted in electric cars and electricity generation using heat from the sun (solar power), water and wind. The possibility of electricity generation from waste is also being explored.</p>



<p>Several arguments have been made in favour of renewable energy; its sources are all around us, it is cheaper, it creates jobs, it is healthier, and all these mean that it makes economic sense.</p>



<p>To ensure everyone is on the same page, countries have been encouraged to develop an energy mix that does not lean heavily on fossil fuels and cut spending/funding for projects powered by fossil fuels. Large corporations and companies have been encouraged to reduce their carbon footprint and offset emissions by donating to green energy projects and planting trees. Companies in the oil &amp; gas sector (including Levene Energy) are also making moves to shift their focus and spending from crude oil to renewable energy.</p>



<p>However, critics have described the green energy campaign as unfair to developing countries like Nigeria. Their argument is that if coal powered the development and industrialisation of European countries, the United States of America and even the United Kingdom, why should oil-rich countries not enjoy using their resources for their development?</p>



<p>Their argument seems valid when the contribution of African countries to greenhouse gas emissions (estimated to be about 3.8%) is considered, yet these countries also bear the brunt of the effects of climate change.</p>



<p>The initial refusal of China and the European Union to fund a ‘loss-and-damage’ fund for the world’s most vulnerable countries, which also have to contend with the effects of climate change, also gives their stance some fuel.</p>



<p>This incident was one of the highlights of the 27th Conference of Parties – the United Nations climate change conference (COP27) held in Egypt. The EU had said that it would only partake in the fund if China were also a donor, insisting that the Asian powerhouse has developed significantly since it was categorised as a developing nation in the 1990s and has now become one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the historical ‘loss-and-damage’ fund was set up. The fund will have a broader funding arrangement outside the UN climate change process from other sources such as insurance, donor contribution, oil &amp; gas tax, and debt relief.</p>



<p>Frans Timmermans, the Vice President of the European Commission, has also said the fund should cover middle-income countries like Pakistan.</p>



<p>The road to sustainable development is a long one for the countries of the world. Energy – whether green or otherwise – will play a crucial role in determining what will be left of our planet in another 100 years.</p>



<p>Will it be cool and green with plants flourishing? Or will it be one hot, chaotic planet with oil spills and other industrial waste? Only time will tell.</p>

the solar panel component of the solar system as it is the most visible. The
solar panels are responsible for transforming light energy to electrical
energy. This is done through what is known as the photoelectric effect. This
simply means that when certain materials (e.g., silicon) are exposed to light,
they will react to the exposure by producing electricity.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">With solar power
systems, the solar panels are where the magic begins, and light is exchanged
for electricity. The challenge is that the electricity produced by the solar
panels is in a raw state and some refining must be done before it is suitable
for ‘consumption’. This is where the next component, the Charge Controller,
comes into play.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">The charge controller

‘family’ analogy, we can consider the Charge Controller as a protector or maybe
a doctor. The Charge Controller receives the electrical power from the solar
panel and gives it a treatment that ensures the electrical power is right for
the battery. This is more like what happens when water is filtered to ensure it
is healthy for human consumption.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">Apart from treating the
power from the solar panels, the Charge Controller ensures that the battery
stops receiving power when it gets fully charged. This ensures the health of
the battery is maintained at optimum capacity. Simply put, the Charge Controller
ensures that the battery is healthy by making sure it is working within safe
limits.<br>

present for a limited number of hours in a day, there must be a way to store
energy produced during the sunlight hours for use when there is no sunlight or
little sunlight. This is where the battery takes the lead. The battery is a
storage system that can be likened to a water tank. You store the excess power
generated in a battery and use this power when you have little or no power from
other sources (i.e., solar panels, power grids or standby generators). The
battery can also receive power from other sources like the generator and
electric power grid. This power is processed by the inverter before being
directed to the battery. The battery is usually what requires the most
attention and is, most of the time, the most expensive component. A wide range
of technologies have been deployed to ensure the battery is safer for use, the
battery’s lifespan is improved, and the battery’s weight is reduced, amongst
many other considerations. Storage holds the key to reliable power supply from
solar power systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">The Inverter (Mr.

mentioned components deal with one form of electric power, and this is Direct
Current (DC) power. However, most of what is powered makes use of another form
of power known as Alternating Current (AC) power. This therefore means that the
power from the solar panels to the charge controller to the battery is all
Direct Current, but the power required by must equipment or appliances is
Alternating Current. To make this change from Direct Current to Alternating
Current, we have to introduce the Inverter. The name ‘inverter’ means to
“invert” from Direct Current (DC) to Alternating current (AC). As simple as the
inverter’s job may seem, a lot is involved in the process of inverting from
Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC). The inverter is one component
that has advanced reasonably with efficiencies getting to as high as 99%. The
charge controller is sometime housed in the same unit as the inverter. This
means that both units will become one and is this consolidated device is called
a “hybrid inverter”.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins;">In Summary<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:

<p><strong>By: Nzan Ogbe, Group Chief Executive Officer, Levene Energy Holdings</strong></p>



<p>Energy remains a necessity of life, helping people to get by every day. But in recent years, investment and conversations around how energy is generated and consumed have witnessed the most dramatic shift. Yet it remains a moving one. Think of the medieval beginnings when early men had to ignite fire through friction from stones to cook food. From that time on to the discovery of coal and other fossils, which powered the industrial revolution of the 18th century and now renewables, humans have always wanted more from energy. This has led to endless discoveries. Energy innovation after innovation has forced people and businesses to constantly adapt to energy changes that can sometimes be disruptive throughout history, shaping how the world around us evolves.</p>



<p>Fossil fuels like coal and crude oil are not only harmful to the planet, but they are also finite resources compromising the safety of future generations and ecosystems. Hence, the global push towards sustainable energy better known as renewables. This includes energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro and biomass which are readily replaced, viable and cannot be depleted, and which emit little or no greenhouse gases (GHG).</p>



<p>In the Nigerian energy scene, the search for sustainable energy had been long-drawn and often marred by indifference on the part of the government coupled with low private investment. This has led to a lack of access to energy in many parts. Until recently, the Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV), is said to be the largest in Africa. BIPVs are products and systems that generate solar power and can be easily integrated into different building parts, including roofs and windows. The project, when completed, will further open up the solar energy space in Nigeria and set the country on the cusp of reaching a new renewable milestone.</p>



<p>As hinted in a recently launched Renewable Energy Roadmap (Remap) by the Nigerian government and the International Renewable Energy Agency, in Nigeria, nearly 60% of the nation’s energy demand by 2050 is projected to be met through renewable energy sources. The global renewable power capacity is expected to grow by 2400 gigawatts (GW) in just five years: between 2022-2027. This is as much as the renewable power added in the last 20 years, according to a recent forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The forecast further indicated that solar and wind sources would be the biggest driver of renewables.</p>



<p>If investments in renewables are aggressive enough, bookmakers are projecting it could drive down costs and give more people access to energy in remote areas, something Levene Energy already has in the pipeline. Following its strategic partnership with NNPC Gas Marketing Limited (NGML) to build and operate gas pipelines, Levene Energy is primed to take advantage of the gas commercialisation policy of the Nigerian government, rapidly evolving as a modern agent of sustainable energy on the African continent.</p>



<p>To harness the abundance of potential that was hitherto untapped in the energy sector as well as achieve Nigeria’s goal of universal access to energy by 2030, government and operators in the energy sector would have to synergise and lead practical initiatives targeted at making more energy companies with the right mix of technologies and private capital key into the nation’s energy sustainability plans. This will fast-track Nigeria’s pursuit of the United Nations&#8217; net-zero emissions plans by 2060 and bolster energy security in a nation of over 200 million people.</p>

<p><strong>By: Nneamaka Atuanya, Senior Geoscientist and Sustainability Champion</strong></p>



<p>As part of a series of editorials on Sustainability and Sustainable Development, we wrote about sustainable energy, the need for sustainable development, and the impact of renewable energy sources. In this month’s article, we will delve into the history of one of the most important sources of renewable energy: Solar Energy.</p>



<p>Human beings have always been aware of the power of the sun and have utilized this energy in ways ranging from drying farm produce using the heat of the sun to heating water for a bath. However, in the year 1839, the way we utilize the energy from the sun changed when a 19-year-old French boy, Edmond Becquerel, discovered the photovoltaic effect and put forward an explanation for how electricity can be generated from exposing a liquid electrolyte to sunlight. Despite the inefficiency of his methods, this paved the way for other scientists like William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day to observe the photovoltaic effect in solidified selenium.</p>



<p>In 1883, Charles Fritz installed a solar cell with less than 1% efficiency. This was a major breakthrough, but at the time, non-renewable power sources were able to produce electricity with higher efficiency, and this meant that the adoption of solar cells was ineffective and very expensive. Advancements in solar cell development stalled until the space race rejuvenated interest in solar energy. This is due to the fact that scientists can generate power using solar cells directly in space; instead of using batteries which were heavier and far more expensive.</p>



<p>As we learnt in the previous editorial on Sustainable Energy published in the February 2023 newsletter, we cannot continue to depend on non-renewable sources of energy, as our increasing demand means that we will exhaust those resources eventually. We need renewable sources of energy to satisfy and maintain our energy needs and direct radiation from the sun is a massive resource that can provide solutions.</p>



<p>Solar energy is likely to become the backbone of global energy systems. Photovoltaic technology has developed rapidly over the last 10 years, with solar cell technologies becoming more efficient and less expensive. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the cost of electricity from utility-scale solar photovoltaics fell by 85% between 2010 and 2020. This means that the use of solar technologies is no longer limited to big budget projects like space travel; we now use solar energy to power our homes, schools, offices, hospitals, communities, worship centers etc. Businesses are now utilizing solar technology as an alternative power source, thereby reducing operating cost and increasing efficiency. In many countries, companies benefit from government incentives and tax credit designed to accelerate deployment of solar technologies.</p>



<p>Aside from government incentives, several international organizations have solar energy funds and carbon credit schemes to enable companies and end users acquire reliable solar solutions and earn carbon credits while utilizing solar energy systems.</p>



<p>As stated in the aforementioned editorial, organizations that utilize renewable energy solutions are smart businesses, and we are about to witness one of the greatest transformations in the global energy system. Companies and organizations should find ways to develop strategic sustainable goals to take advantage of some of these funds and incentives by investing in a sustainable project or by utilizing renewable energy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>By: Nzan Ogbe, Group Chief Executive Officer, Levene Energy Holdings</strong></p>



<p>As Africa’s largest economy, Nigeria is strategically positioned to be a significant player in the global economy. Given the right support and the fact that the country is potentially fertile ground for massive growth and development, Nigerian businesses can claim the top spot globally. But for this to happen, several issues must be considered.</p>



<p>Entrepreneurship largely depends on the existence, maintenance, and improvement of adequate infrastructure. Given that Nigerian roads, ports, and airports are often in disrepair, it has made logistics a nightmare, and reaching new markets has become a difficult challenge. Additionally, there is the insidious challenge of frequent power outages, which disrupt business operations, making it difficult for businesses to attain optimal performance, and this, in turn, hinders competitiveness for Nigerian businesses, both locally and internationally. It would be easier for a business in a country with already existing basic infrastructure to grapple with other essential issues such as finding customers, recruiting, and retaining staff, expanding to new and foreign markets, etc.</p>



<p>However, when one has to constantly expend most of their capital on buying fuel for backup generators, vehicle repair, costly transportation, and excessive turnovers, one begins to wonder at what cost an average entrepreneur would be able to develop and maintain their customer base as well as reach new markets.</p>



<p>For a country tilting towards industrialization, thanks to the increasing number of manufacturers, production is only sustainable if these infrastructural needs are met. Most of the work to be done in this regard lies with the government and the people of Nigeria, who must adopt a production mindset, contrary to the consumption mentality that existed before this era.</p>



<p>Another crippling issue of competition among SMEs in Nigeria is the lack of access to capital. Many businesses do not have adequate access to capital at reasonable rates, and this limits their ability to grow and compete. As a result of the lack of support from financial institutions, SMEs often struggle to secure needed funding. Nigerian businesses must invest in the latest technology and training to ensure growth and success in today&#8217;s global market. They need funding to make these investments. A quick solution would be for the government to conduct a review and implement existing regulations, the passing of more business-friendly laws, and expressly encouraging more financial institutions to lend to SMEs. Alternatively, businesses can seek other sources of financing, such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, which have become increasingly popular in recent years.</p>



<p>Yet another significant challenge is corruption. Businesses are often faced with this issue, especially in their first few years, but even older businesses are not exempt from its effects. Corruption is a major obstacle that plays a part in every sector of the country. For SMEs, corruption is a familiar enemy, and the consequences are stunted growth, lack of competition and, ultimately, this leads to the death of innovation. Many businesses are over-taxed by government officials who demand bribes for ‘little favours’. This increases businesses&#8217; difficulties in operating effectively and limits the incentives found in systems where healthy competition is encouraged. Naturally, this leads to a lack of trust in the business community, as well as a loss of confidence in the government. To resolve this, the government, as well as the people, must take a zero-tolerance approach to corruption and work to create a more transparent and trustworthy business environment to attract investors and encourage competition, thereby making it easier for businesses in Nigeria to reach their full potential.</p>



<p>The most basic aspect of entrepreneurship is innovation. This is why SMEs must take steps to become more competitive. Investing in technology and training is a perfect way to improve operations and gain a competitive advantage. Businesses can increase their efficiency and competitiveness by adopting modern technologies such as cloud computing and data analytics because what gets measured gets done. Training and development opportunities must be provided for employees to achieve consistency in this area. Another result that can be achieved by this form of investment is that employees are more likely to be retained, especially those who are talented and whose careers would benefit greatly from these self-development initiatives. Employees generally stay when they feel like they are part of a bigger dream. Companies that invest in their employees and provide them with growth opportunities are more likely to retain talented employees, giving them a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>One other way to enhance the capacity of employees is through mentorship. Businesses can set up mentorship programmed to help employees at all levels, from new hires to executives, with advice and support. By implementing strong mentorship programmes, businesses in Nigeria can tap into the knowledge, experience, and expertise of seasoned professionals and develop the skills and competencies needed to compete on a global stage.</p>



<p>Diversification of products and services is also an excellent way of increasing competitiveness. New markets offer fresh perspectives, challenges and opportunities. Total reliance on a specific product or market could limit the business and its potential for expansion and expose it to economic downturns. If a business can tap into new and growing markets, it can increase its competitive advantage.</p>



<p>For global dominance, Nigerian businesses must look beyond the country’s borders and explore opportunities in other African countries. An opportunity for Nigerian businesses to access a market of over 1.3 billion people and a GDP of over $3 trillion has come to light with Nigeria’s ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement which came into effect in January 2021. Businesses can now take advantage of the growing intra-African trade and expand their customer base. This will not only help them to become more competitive globally but will also contribute to the overall economic development of Africa.</p>



<p>In conclusion, for Nigerian businesses to compete globally, both the Nigerian government and stakeholders in these industries must come together in their numbers to address the issues as stated above. The government must take the lead in addressing infrastructure and corruption issues, while businesses must focus on investing in technology and training (including mentorship), diversifying their products and services, and exploring new markets.</p>

<p><strong>By: Nneamaka Atuanya, Senior Geoscientist and Sustainability Champion</strong></p>



<p>In the previous editorial in this series, we introduced the concepts of Sustainability and Sustainable Development. In this edition, we will focus on Sustainable Energy and why it is necessary for sustainable development.</p>



<p>John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies defines Sustainable Energy as energy derived from resources that can fulfill our current energy needs without compromising the energy needs, environment, or climate of future generations.</p>



<p><strong>Sustainable energy? Why now:</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, sustainable energy is key to ending global energy poverty and subsequently, many other forms of poverty. Energy poverty, according to Habitat for Humanity, is a lack of adequate, affordable, reliable, quality, safe, and environmentally sound energy services to support development. Solving energy poverty is very crucial to solving environmental and social problems as it is impossible to develop the agricultural and manufacturing sectors without sufficient energy. Inadequate energy traps the poorest countries in a vicious poverty cycle as they cannot afford the energy that can drive them out of poverty.</p>



<p>Sustainable energy is about solving social and health problems using environmentally clean and affordable forms of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, about 1.2 billion people globally lack access to electricity and solely depend on sunlight to function. This reality, as you can imagine, drastically reduces the productive and leisure time of these people.</p>



<p>Poor accessibility to national electricity structures, funding, and lack of suitable technology have made it very difficult and expensive to connect such communities to traditional electrical infrastructure. With sustainable energy, most of these challenges become solvable as the sources of energy (sun, wind, biomass) are locally and readily accessible. Taking solar energy as an example, the energy required (from the sun) to generate electricity is readily available. With the community being the main beneficiary of this, they can also take charge of managing, maintaining, and securing the renewable energy infrastructure.</p>



<p>The level of development and empowerment a simple off-grid solar power system can bring to a community is unimaginable. With electrified classrooms and streetlights, students will have access to information technology and will be motivated to study more. With solar powered equipment/machines farmers, hunters, fishermen can produce more, and better preserve some of their produce with refrigerators. With solar-powered pumping machines, cleaner water can be provided, and better sanitation can be achieved. A reliable solar power system will enable a more effective healthcare care services in rural communities.</p>



<p>The adoption of sustainable energy entails much more than solving social problems; it is smart business – very smart. Globally, the sustainable energy industry accounts for an annual revenue of about USD$1.4 billion. Additionally, the three largest financial institutions in the United States of America (Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America) have pledged to commit over USD$370 billion to the renewable energy and low carbon sector by 2025.</p>



<p>Technology, internal innovation, and purposeful investment are key to proffering solutions to the challenge of access to clean and affordable energy. For example, the perfection of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) technologies has allowed for buildings to be powered by BIPV panels, reducing energy costs drastically.</p>



<p>As we learn more about sustainable energy we will see how off-grid technologies provide key solutions.</p>



<p>In the next article we will spotlight on some of these solutions and their financial opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>By: Nzan Ogbe, Group Chief Executive Officer, Levene Energy Holdings</strong></p>



<p>Over the past three decades, there have been rising concerns about the environmental impact of climate change, as well as the economic implications of burning carbon-based fuels. These concerns have inspired innovation in the field of renewable energy for mass consumption. The Climate Change 2022; Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveals that over 40 percent of the global population is being pushed beyond its limits to adapt to climate change. As part of the United Nations&#8217; continued efforts to ensure that global warming doesn&#8217;t exceed the 1.5°C mark, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was echoed throughout the annual UN meeting on climate, Conference of Parties (COPs), that was held late last year in Egypt, to deliberate on sustainability strategies to mitigate global warming.</p>



<p>With over 200 government representatives, the conference served as a melting pot of strategies for reducing emissions, including helping countries prepare for and deal with climate change and securing technical support and funding for developing countries that lacked supporting infrastructure. To be sure, the cumulative climb in global temperature is solely a human factor contributed by the burning of fossil fuels that, include oil, gas, and coal.</p>



<p>While it makes sense on paper to shun the burning of fossil fuels to lower emissions, it is worth noting the economic impact. The oil and gas sector provides 85% of global energy needs, so a drastic shift might prove counterproductive. For instance, a 2022 report by Reuters elaborated on how the festering Russia-Ukraine war is disrupting the gas supply to the European Union (EU)—clearly demonstrating how economies are hooked on crude oil.</p>



<p>This dependency on crude oil can be elucidated in its contributions to the gross domestic product (GDP) of oil-producing countries, its role in facilitating industrial processes, and its influence on lifestyle. A total removal would only harshly remind the world of its heavy reliance on crude oil, thus posing a dilemma. Through sustainability strategies, the oil and gas industry can better adhere to Health, Safety, and Environmental regulations to positively impact their immediate environment. These strategies buy time to shift to more sustainable energy sources.</p>



<p>By 2030, renewable energy sources will account for 65% of global electricity and could decarbonize 90% of the power sector (Renewable Energy – Powering a Safer Future, a UN report projects). Currently, the oil and gas sector is inching towards investing in energy-efficient solutions.</p>



<p>Since the 1980s, renewable energy projects such as wind and solar have been introduced to lessen fossil fuel reliance methodically, and over time, the technology behind harnessing these renewable energies has improved significantly from the first-generation models that generated meagre energy.</p>



<p>With technological advancements in the development of cheap, renewable energy, more and more oil and gas companies or energy companies are in the process of transitioning from fossil fuel combustion. Nigerian energy solution providers like Levene Energy are at the forefront of building this new frontier.</p>



<p>From inception, Levene Energy has continued to make significant strides in the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors via a series of group diversification efforts that introduced subsidiaries positioned to offer sustainable energy solutions at all levels of the oil and gas value chain.</p>



<p>Guided by the United Nations Development Programme&#8217;s (UNDP) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to attain a low-carbon future through carbon reduction projects, Levene Energy entered into a strategic partnership with a pioneering renewable and sustainable energy company to birth a joint venture enterprise known as LPV Technologies (LPV).</p>



<p>In September 2021, LPV embarked on a historical project of retrofitting a 17-storey building with Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), earning it the bragging rights of executing the largest installation of BIPV in Africa.</p>



<p>The solar power generating system composed of 955 KWp BIPV and a 2.0 MWh storage unit produces 1.0 MWp of clean energy that is sufficient for the building&#8217;s daily energy needs, thus decreasing their number of emissions and strain on the power grid.</p>



<p>Climate change is a global emergency, one that requires proactive steps that introduce green energy solutions. But where this isn&#8217;t attainable due to economic restraint or technology, transitioning to low-carbon fuel alternatives is the best bet. Natural gas is a low-carbon fuel juxtaposed with high-content fossil fuels like coal and oil. The adoption of gas will help reduce carbon emissions.</p>



<p>Through another one of its component entities called Aegon Distribution Limited (which is a midstream-focused offshoot), Levene Energy has joined the leading global energy solutions companies in providing the infrastructure needed to transition from diesel to gas. Signing an Unincorporated Joint Venture (UJV) with NNPC Gas Marketing Limited (NGML), it has commenced building and operating gas pipelines to locations where the low carbon fossil is needed.</p>



<p>In other cases, when renewable energy or low-carbon fuel is not an alternative, the entire oil and gas value chain can be optimized, not for the production of greener fuels, but to ensure that technologies help in making better operational choices in the upstream sector, and not to negatively impact the environment.</p>



<p>Traditional Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) methods are crude and contribute significantly to the carbon footprint by emitting gases like methane. Clean technology solutions adopted by She-Val Engineering (another component entity within the Group) promotes the sustainability of other resources, such as decreasing the volume of freshwater used in the extraction of crude oil. This is a significant intervention because Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa.</p>



<p>The race to reverse climate change&#8217;s impact, evident in melting ice caps in the northern hemisphere, rising sea levels, food shortage, and extreme weather, is gaining momentum. Many of the set goals will certainly be attained in the coming years through the innovation of tech-forward firms like Levene Energy Group.</p>



<p>By and large, innovative technology will catch up with climate change and stop it in its tracks.</p>

<p><strong>By: Obim Ogbe, Group Deputy General Manager, Corporate Services</strong></p>



<p>Conversations surrounding mental health remain a taboo subject, particularly in the context of African society, in general and especially in the workplace. There exists a stigma attached to anyone who suggests that they are going through a difficult time mentally. The implication being that such a person is seen as weak or ‘less than’. These can be harmful stereotypes, particularly when allied with the fact that it consequently prevents people dealing with such challenges to speak up and seek appropriate help. From firsthand experience, it is imperative to state categorically how important the support of loved ones, family, friends and colleagues is to people who experience challenges with their mental health, particularly in the midst of navigating life as an adult in the world we currently live in. Granted, practically everyone experiences one form of pressure or the other, whether it be at work or at home, professionally or personally. However, by virtue of the fact that we are all created uniquely, it goes without saying that we react to pressures (external or otherwise) in different ways. Therapists can confirm that in some cases, the effects of mental health challenges on a person’s anatomy can actually present in physical manifestation such that it can alter the way your body reacts and even weakens one’s immune system, leading to suffering other ailments that would typically not be directly linked to proper brain function.</p>



<p>It is with this in mind that we urge everyone to take conversations surrounding mental health seriously. Whether it be in a family unit, a religious community or even (and especially) in the workplace, considering that is where most adults spend a majority of their time, interacting with colleagues and/or customers and clients (depending on the sector they work in or their specific job function). At Levene Energy, our Health Management Organization (HMO) offers resources that help alleviate the effects of mental health challenges on members of staff and we encourage employees to take advantage of these resources.</p>



<p>For as long as human beings have been in existence, there has always been and will always be a need for support from a community. To anyone experiencing challenges and seeking professional help, just know that it is a marathon and not a sprint. So, take it one day at a time and all things considered, with proper guidance and the support of medical professionals and loved ones, know that better days are up ahead.</p>



<p>For comprehensive resources on mental health awareness, please contact a certified medical professional or your HMO.</p>

<p><strong>By: Nneamaka Atuanya, Senior Geoscientist and Sustainability Champion</strong></p>



<p>As a Geoscientist whose main goal in over 12 years has been to employ the most efficient and cost-effective means of exploiting oil and gas resources, I am thrilled to be writing this editorial, and that you – the reader – have decided to embark on this sustainable journey with us in 2023. My journey into sustainability has really changed my world view and I wish the same for you.</p>



<p>In this article, we will introduce the concepts of Sustainability and Sustainable Development. Different definitions exist for sustainability depending on context, but they generally mean the same thing. The Cambridge dictionary states that, “Sustainability is the quality of being able to continue over a period of time”. Defining sustainability on its own does not give us the required background for this journey however, which is why we will also talk about sustainable development.</p>



<p>According to United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) report, ‘Our Common Future (1987)’, sustainable development is the ability to meet the present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This call to a conscious way of living and doing business gives us the power to decide whether future generations will thrive or not, and it is a huge responsibility.</p>



<p>At the heart of the WCED report are the 3 P’s: Profit, Planet, People. This can also be known as the 3 E’s: Economy, Environment, and Equity. In order to be considered sustainable, businesses must be able to utilize natural resources reasonably, support a healthy community and their workforce, and earn enough revenue to remain financially feasible for the long-term (Source: Investopedia).</p>



<p>These principles are at the center of all Levene Energy’s business strategies and decisions. As an innovative and ever-evolving energy company, we continuously integrate sustainable practices into our business model. Levene Energy, through its joint venture company, LPV Energies Limited, leverages on the latest technology, innovative design, and seamless project execution to deliver top notch renewable energy solutions to our clients and customers. Currently, LPV Energies is executing the largest Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) project in Africa. Furthermore, there are other projects in the pipeline to provide power using solar energy in rural areas in Nigeria.</p>



<p>With Gas being accepted as a transition energy source, Levene Energy has taken strategic actions to build and operate gas pipelines by signing an Unincorporated Joint Venture (UJV) agreement with the NNPC Gas Marketing Limited (NGML) to distribute gas across different locations in Nigeria. Based on our 2023 goals, we have specific sustainable practices we wish to integrate, and we have identified the metrics by which we will measure our progress. We will share our journey with all our stakeholders as we proceed, so stay tuned.</p>
